I found these by performing the levels function on a random actor and modified it to print out each neighbor if it was level 6 or higher. The last neighbor printed out is the farthest away and I check it with the level sizes result to make sure that the last printed out is in at least the 6th level, meaning I have a thespian-thespian pair that has a degree of separation greater than or equal to 6.
